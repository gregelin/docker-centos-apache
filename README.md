# Prereq's 

This assumes that you have downloaded Vagrant (www.vagrantup.com), Oracle VM VirtualBox 
(www.virtualbox.org), and Docker (www.docker.io). 

# Starting your VM

  Create Vagrant Directory and switch to that directory  
```
  $mkdir ~/vagrant
  $cd ~/vagrant 
```

  Place the Vagrantfile here and create a htdocs directory parallel to that file
```
  $touch Vagrantfile #place code from this repo here
  $mkdir htdocs
```

  Switch to htdocs directory and create a index.html file
```
  $cd htdocs
  $touch index.html #place code from this repo here
```
